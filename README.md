# Project

I would like to create a simple side-scrolling or other 2D game whose focus is on the story rather than the gameplay. The 
protagonist of the game will be a hen or turkey. The player will first escape from a market or butcher shop (note: no gruesome art will
be included) and then make her way to Farm Sanctuary, where she will meet farm animals who have been spared a life of exploitation and 
are living out the remainder of their lives peacefully. 

Gameplay will consist of moving the character around with the arrow keys and using the enter key to interact with her surroundings. Each 
animal she interacts with will share their rescue story and a bit about themselves/their life at Farm Sanctuary. All animals in the game 
will be based on real rescued animals. The initial butcher shop/market scene will conclude with some information about the exploitation of 
farm animals, and the end scene of the game [which will take place at Farm Sanctuary] will display some information about vegan 
ethics/worldview, Farm Sanctuary, and a hopeful message for humanity. 

I chose this project idea because I like video games, I'm passionate about veganism/animal rights, and I love Farm Sanctuary. I hope to create 
something that could potentially "plant a seed" in someone's mind that could lead them to change their ideas about humans' relationship to 
non-human animals. :sheep: :rooster: :cow2: :pig2:
